    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic until soft, about 5 minutes.
            Stir
            in red bell pepper and carrot; cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook and stir until softened, about 2
            minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour wine into the pot; simmer until slightly reduced, about 1 minute. Stir in diced tomatoes and vegetable
            broth. Bring sauce to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until flavors combine, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in
            lentils,
            paprika, basil, oregano, dried herbs, and nutmeg; cook until lentils are heated through, about 5 minutes.
